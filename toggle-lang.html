Prompt:
I have a website. The english site is under `<baseurl>/`, where as the Chinese version is under `<baseurl>/zh-TW/`. Please help me write a javascript function `toggleLang` which can help me switch between these two versions. For example, when I'm at `<baseurl>/whatever/page`, call the function via `javascript:toggleLang();` will jump to `<baseurl>/zh-TW/whatever/page`; on the other hand, when I'm at `<baseurl>/zh-TW/whatever/page`, call the function jumps to `<baseurl>/whatever/page`.

KEYNOTE:
- ChatGPT doesn't do this job well. `basePath` is critical to make this script works.
