## Requirement

```{julia}
#| echo: false
using Markdown, GEMSMagTIPDocumentation
open(dir_0("GEMS-MagTIP-insider/_environment.txt")) do str
    Markdown.parse(read(str, String))
end
```

## Getting Started
The [main functions](../doc_library/index.qmd#main-functions) of GEMS-MagTIP take directories that contains intermediate data (those `.mat` files) as input arguments, and output data in the assigned directory. 

Here is the minimal example of the chain of main functions:

```matlab
dir_catalog = 'data\spreadsheet'; 
        % directory of event catalog & station location
dir_data = 'data\geomag_1'; 
        % directory of geomagnetic timeseries
dir_stat = 'output_var\StatisticIndex'; 
        % directory of statistic indices
dir_tsAIN = 'output_var\tsAIN'; 
        % directory for storing anomaly index number (AIN)
dir_molchan = 'output_var\Molchan'; 
        % directory for storing Molchan scores
dir_jointstation = 'output_var\JointStation'; 
        % directory for the time series of EQK, TIP and probability
```

```matlab
statind(dir_data,dir_stat); 

anomalyind(dir_stat,dir_tsAIN); 

molscore(dir_tsAIN,dir_catalog,dir_molchan); 

molscore3(dir_tsAIN,dir_molchan,dir_catalog,dir_jointstation); 
```


In this document, the input/output variable that contains the information of the path to a directory (i.e., a folder) is prefixed by `dir_`; for example, `dir_data` is the directory for the formatted geomagnetic data, and `dir_stat` is the directory for statistic indices. 
The `dir_`-prefixed variables are each a sequence of characters being something like `'D:\MagTIP-2022\output_var\StatisticIndex'`. 

### The Sample Script for Everything
There is a script **"demo/demo_script.m"** contains the sample codes of the whole process; you can easily make everything set and go through the entire MagTIP procedures following the steps below:
- switch current directory to the folder named "MagTIP-2022"
- run section(s) in the script

In the beginning (the first three sections), you will see several pop-out windows for selecting the directory of geomagnetic data (`dir_data`) and loading the toolbox (`dir_toolbox`). 
Select the right folders as instructed, and they will be automatically added to path and be ready to use.
