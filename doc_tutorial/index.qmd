## Requirement

```{julia}
#| echo: false
using Markdown, GEMSMagTIPDocumentation
open(dir_0("GEMS-MagTIP-insider/_environment.txt")) do str
    Markdown.parse(read(str, String))
end
```

## Getting Started
The main functions of MagTIP take directories that contains necessary files as input arguments, and all output variables are saved in another directory as ".mat" files.
In this document, the input/output variable that contains the information of the path to a directory (i.e., a folder) is prefixed by `dir_`; for example, `dir_data` is the directory for the formatted geomagnetic data, and `dir_stat` is the directory for statistic indices. 
The `dir_`-prefixed variables are each a sequence of characters being something like `'D:\MagTIP-2022\output_var\StatisticIndex'`. 

### The Sample Script for Everything
There is a script **"demo/demo_script.m"** contains the sample codes of the whole process; you can easily make everything set and go through the entire MagTIP procedures following the steps below:
- switch current directory to the folder named "MagTIP-2022"
- run section(s) in the script

In the beginning (the first three sections), you will see several pop-out windows for selecting the directory of geomagnetic data (`dir_data`) and loading the toolbox (`dir_toolbox`). 
Select the right folders as instructed, and they will be automatically added to path and be ready to use.
