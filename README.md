## Introduction

GEMS-MagTIP is an integrated algorithm that calculates the Time of Increased Probability (TIP) for earthquakes based on geoelectric and geomagnetic field data. 
It represents the culmination of advancements from the earlier GEMSTIP and MagTIP systems, combining their methodologies into a multivariate framework that supports diverse data sources.

### Historical Development

The development began with GEMSTIP (Geoelectric Monitoring System's Time of Increased Probability), which focused on geoelectric field anomalies. GEMSTIP utilized predictive modeling, binary classification, and statistical analysis to identify earthquake precursors in geoelectric data. This system demonstrated significant correlations between geoelectric anomalies and seismic events and was instrumental in establishing the feasibility of probabilistic earthquake forecasting.

Building upon GEMSTIP, MagTIP expanded the algorithm to include geomagnetic field data. 
It greatly improves computational efficiency, support for both full-field and triaxial magnetic data, and introduces a rolling forecast system. 
MagTIP's advancements made it possible to integrate data from both modern and legacy instruments, ensuring the preservation and utilization of valuable historical records.


### GEMS-MagTIP: Unified and Multivariate

The current GEMS-MagTIP system integrates the capabilities of both GEMSTIP and MagTIP, enabling the simultaneous use of geoelectric and geomagnetic data. 
This multivariate system supports a wide range of geo-electromagnetic data types, including three-component and one-component signals, in the calculation of statistical indicators (e.g., skewness, kurtosis, Fisher Information, Shannon Entropy) for earthquake's time of increased probability.

GEMS-MagTIP system represents an advancement in earthquake precursor research.
It provides a robust and adaptable tool to identify geo-electromagnetic anomalies correlated with large earthquake events, and allows joint-station probabilistic earthquake forecasting based on the concept of TIP.
